## Overview

## Hardware Preparison

Based on the [CUBE-RK3588](https://github.com/MayQueenTechCommunity/CUBE-RK3588) hardware design, SPI interface support was not originally included. However, you have a option to use the SPI interface from UART interfaces on CUBE-RK3588: <br>

The CUBE-RK3588 SPI can be connected as follows COM1 & COM2 mapping:

## Driver Installation instructions

|Kernel|Tested|
|---|---|
| 6.1 |&#10004;|

Step 1. Download the kernel source and modify the target device tree file: rk3588-b675.dts <br>
Step 2. Merge the patch as follows modification from UART to SPI, a quick way is download these code as a patch, then use git apply into the kernel source.<br>

```

Step 3. Recompile the kernel and copy the new dtb file to the boot partition instead of the old one. <br>
Step 4. Boot up the system and checking the device node is exist or not <br>

    ls /dev/spidev4.0
    

## User-Space Utility instructions (Linux OS)

Step 1. Install necessary packages

        Ubuntu/Debian:
        $ sudo apt install gpiod libgpiod-dev

        Yocto:
        Need add the line in machine conf file as following:
        IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " libgpiod"

Step 2. Prepare a 250x122 size picture what you want to showing, then make a image raw data based header file

        Download the PNG to RAW converter base on python3, remember to install opencv package first
        $ sudo apt install python3-opencv
        $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-EPD/user-space-examples/refs/heads/master/2.13/color/spi/png2epd.py

        Then, rename your PNG file as test.png, and excute the python script
        $ python3 png2epd.py

        It will generate a output file: png_HEX.h, the copy the same folder witth pixpaper-213-c-test-imx8mp.c.
        Note that this step can running on host PC side or target board, but png_HEX.h must be put into the folder with c file together before 
        compiling.

        Download a sample header file:
        $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-EPD/user-space-examples/refs/heads/master/2.13/color/spi/png_HEX.h


Step 3. Please download the utility source code in the rootfs of CUBE-RK3588, then compile it and execute the compiled executable file.

        PIXPAPER-213-C:
        # wget https://github.com/open-EPD/user-space-examples/raw/refs/heads/master/2.13/color/spi/pixpaper-213-c-test-rk3588.c
        # gcc -o epd_test pixpaper-213-c-test-rk3588.c -lgpiod
        # ./epd_test

        Note that if your wired connection is different with chapter 1 "Hardware Preparison", especially DC# PIN, RST# PIN, and BUSY PIN,
        please modify the specific macros definition of pixpaper-213-c-test-imx8mp.c:

        #define EPD_GPIO_CHIP "gpiochip4"
        #define EPD_DC_PIN 26
        #define EPD_RST_PIN 27
        #define EPD_BUSY_PIN 29

final image is some procgress bar with black background <br>
